# Story Data Info

Structure: Take a look at storyNode.ts 

How a Story Node works:
- Exposition is the beginning of the scene, alway on a black screen white text in the middle. Iterate through the `exposition` array.
- Conversation is the dilog between the three charecters **N**arrator, **S**apling, **O**ak. The beginning of each line will have either `N: `, `S: `, `O: `, to denote who is talking. There may be optional modifiers like `S-s: ` to make the entire line small/meek, this is a stretch goal.
- Next File - this will be the next scene file to load.

## Scope Change Announcment

Alright team, I was tossing and turning all night trying to get the complexity of the stories to work in my head. I think I bit off more than I can chew, since we only have 48 hours. I'm going to suggest we turn this into a visual novel, with no choice, with the following story:

A new soul, named sapling, enters the afterlife and goes through the 5 stages of grief due to dying. There they meet an old soul, named oak, to help them through the process. After each stage, the roots grow a little stronger during the black card exposition. Then by acceptance, the roots of their relationship are mighty!

## TODOs
- Fade in on exposition, not typed text -- or just slow it down

## Story ( Not Final )

“When the roots are deep there is no reason to fear the wind.”

- Denial
	Exposition: Denial.

	Conversation:
	N: A new soul pops into existence; Sapling. Across the way, an old soul resides; Oak. Behind them stands a strong tree, a symbol of their connection. How far do the roots go?
