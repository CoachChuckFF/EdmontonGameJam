# Story Data Info

Structure: Take a look at storyNode.ts 

How a Story Node works:
- Exposition is the beginning of the scene, alway on a black screen white text in the middle. Iterate through the `exposition` array.
- Conversation is the dilog between the three charecters **N**arrator, **S**apling, **O**ak. The beginning of each line will have either `N: `, `S: `, `O: `, to denote who is talking. There may be optional modifiers like `S-s: ` to make the entire line small/meek, this is a stretch goal.
- Next File - this will be the next scene file to load.

## Scope Change Announcment

Alright team, I was tossing and turning all night trying to get the complexity of the stories to work in my head. I think I bit off more than I can chew, since we only have 48 hours. I'm going to suggest we turn this into a visual novel, with no choice, with the following story:

A new soul, named sapling, enters the afterlife and goes through the 5 stages of grief due to dying. There they meet an old soul, named oak, to help them through the process. After each stage, the roots grow a little stronger during the black card exposition. Then by acceptance, the roots of their relationship are mighty!

- Denial
    Exposition: Denial.

    Conversation:
    Narrator: A new soul pops into existence; let’s call them Sapling. Across the way, an old soul resides; we’ll call them Oak. A budding new relationship, will their roots grow strong or wither away?

    S: Hey you, what the hell are you? Why are you floating? Why am I floating? What is this place??
    O: This is the afterlife, you have died.
    S: What do you mean, died? I’m right here? I’m talking to you!
    O: If you’re here, you’re dead, it’s the way of this place.
    S: …
    S: NOPE.
    S: What type of optical Illusion is this… There’s no way I’m dead. I was just… What was I doing? Why can’t I remember?
    O: Don’t worry, your memories from the past life will come back, they always do.
    S: There is no ‘past life’, IM NOT DEAD.
    S: NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.
    O: It’s ok, you’re in denial. Sit with it, and allow yourself to realize the truth. Take your time. It is ok. 
    S: …
    S: …
    S: …
    S: ok. I’m dead.
