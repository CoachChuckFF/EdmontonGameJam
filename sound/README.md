# Sound Design

Dawn has found us some ambient noise to loop through each stage of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance. 

Ideally, these loops fade out as the scene changes.

Growth should happen at every Exposition - as the text is being typed out. Do not let them move on until the sound byte is done

Background, should be the music looping through the entire game ( or if it's too much, take it all out )
